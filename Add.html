    <h1>Summary of Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet (the cloud). This technology allows users to access and use these services on a pay-as-you-go basis, without having to invest in physical infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service:</strong> Users can provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Broad Network Access:</strong> Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms, promoting use by heterogeneous platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops).</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Pooling:</strong> The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Service Models</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS).</li>
        <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically used for application development. Example: Google App Engine.</li>
        <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Example: Microsoft Office 365.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Deployment Models</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are offered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Services are maintained on a private network, dedicated to a single organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Cloud computing provides numerous benefits, including cost savings, scalability, flexibility, and accessibility, making it a popular choice for businesses and individuals alike.</p>
